App Concept: EcoSignal
-social app where users post geo-tagged content (photos/videos) to report or highlight events like:
	illegal deforestation
	Wildlife sightings
	Pollution
	Fires
	Water contamination

Main Features
1. Posts + Media Upload 
-Users create posts (text + image/video) with a location tag
-Data stored in PostgreSQL, with S3 or similar for media

2. Map Integration
-Frontend displays a map (OpenStreetMap or Google Maps)
-Backend stores coordinates for posts
-Cluster and color-code posts based on type/severity/model predictions
-Data for PySpark: spatial clustering, density analysis, heatmaps, etc.

3. Computer Vision Integration
When a user uploads an image:
	It is sent to a model (CV-based) that classifies it: e.g., "deforestation", "littering", "fire", etc.
	Model outputs a tag/category that is saved to the post
Tech stack:
	PyTorch or TensorFlow model served via REST or gRPC
	Model runs on GPU if high traffic
CV Model Types:
	Image classification (e.g., ResNet)
	Object detection (YOLO for detecting tree stumps, smoke, etc.)
4. Recommendation Engine (PySpark)
	Use PySpark MLlib or custom pipelines to build a recommendation system:
		Approach			Data Needed
		Content-based			Post tags, categories, CV model labels
		Collaborative filtering		User-post interactions (likes, saves, views)
		Hybrid				Combine both

	Spark can process this data daily to produce personalized post suggestions for users.

5. Alert System
	If many similar posts are clustered in a region â†’ trigger a warning
	PySpark jobs can scan for high-frequency, high-severity posts and generate "events"

6. Analytics Dashboard
	Users (or authorities) see trends:
	Deforestation increase per area
	Pollution spike heatmaps
	Seasonal animal sightings
	Powered by aggregated Spark jobs + frontend dashboards (React + Chart.js / D3)
